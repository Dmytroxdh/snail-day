<!-- This was my first personal project that involved teaching myself a few new things. 
It lines up with a date-specific joke I have with some friends so this was a great way to show off my new skill in a comedic way
From this I learned:
How buttons work in HTML and how to embed links within them.
About how formatting rules can vary across browsers
Altering youtube links to autoplay
